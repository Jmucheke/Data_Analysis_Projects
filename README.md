# 🏃‍♂️ Fitness Activity Data Analysis Project

---
This data is used to:
- Calculate **daily step totals**
- Find **weekly averages**
- Plot **bubble charts** to show activity across the week
- Generate **pie charts** to visualize user activity share


## 📈 Features Implemented

- ✅ Parse and transform raw hourly step data
- ✅ Convert hourly data into daily summaries
- ✅ Compute safe averages (avoiding divide-by-zero errors)
- ✅ Sort users based on total or average steps
- ✅ Create visualizations:
  - Bubble plots (steps per day per user)
  - Pie charts (share of total weekly activity)
- ✅ Save plots automatically


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- Custom sorting and data transformation functions


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries (e.g., `pip install matplotlib numpy`)
3. Run the script: `python main.py`
4. Generated visualizations will be saved to the specified output folder


## 📌 Project Goal

This project is a hands-on demonstration of your ability to turn raw data into actionable insights using Python. It simulates a real-world data analysis task.

## ✨ Deliverables

- Clean, readable Python code
- Visual plots saved as `.png` files
- Documentation (this README)
- Optional: Jupyter Notebook walkthrough or report summary
